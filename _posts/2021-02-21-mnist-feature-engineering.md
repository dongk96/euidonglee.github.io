1. Classify handwritten digits by using conventional machine learning techniques. ***(Non Deep learning)***
2. Improve performance with ***feature engineering.***

## Dataset
**Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)**

Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name):
  print("hello", name)
print_hi('Tom')
```
