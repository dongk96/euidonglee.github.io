## Objective
1. Classify handwritten digits by using conventional machine learning techniques. ***(Non Deep learning)***
2. Improve performance with ***feature engineering.***

## Dataset
###### Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)

The famous MNIST dataset is compressed from 28 * 28 pixels to 8x8 pixels, adding some optical distortion to the image. The digits are written by a total of 43 writers.
